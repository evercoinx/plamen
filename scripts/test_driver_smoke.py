"""Live smoke tests for plamen_driver.py phase-loop policy.

Pytest-discoverable integration tests. Each scenario spawns a subprocess
that monkeypatches run_phase to exercise the driver's phase-loop policy
without needing Claude CLI or network access.

Run all:    pytest test_driver_smoke.py -v
Run fast:   pytest test_driver_smoke.py -v -m "not slow"
Standalone: python test_driver_smoke.py

Eleven scenarios:
  A. Breadth critical halt + resume retry
     Silent breadth. Assert EXIT_DEGRADED=3, `breadth.degraded` marker,
     `breadth` IN degraded / NOT IN completed. Second run must retry
     breadth without re-running recon/instantiate.
  B. Manifest-aware quorum override
     Instantiate writes a real 5-row `spawn_manifest.md`. Breadth writes
     only 3 `analysis_*.md` files. Assert the quorum ratchets 3 -> 5 and
     breadth halts despite having artifacts on disk.
  C. Empty-verify short-circuit
     Upstream phases succeed. `findings_inventory.md` + `hypotheses.md`
     contain ZERO Medium+ markers. Assert verify writes `verify_NONE.md`,
     is marked completed (not degraded), and pipeline proceeds to report.
  D. Depth manifest-aware quorum override
     L1 writes `phase4b_manifest.md` declaring 5 depth agents. Depth writes
     only 3 `depth_*_findings.md` files. Assert depth halts despite clearing
     the old fixed floor of 3.
  E. Depth pre-baked gatefail enforcement
     L1 depth writes enough artifacts to satisfy the glob gate, but appends a
     `[GATE FAIL] ... pre-baked reads` violation. Assert the driver retries
     depth once, then degrades/halts on the second violation.
  F. Never-cut checkpoint/artifact enforcement
     L1 depth clears quorum but omits one required post-depth artifact and
     checkpoint entry. Assert the driver retries once, then degrades/halts.
  G. Depth exit validation
     L1 depth clears quorum and writes all artifacts, but `depth_exit.md`
     has an invalid criterion / insufficient explored paths. Assert retry and
     degrade/halt.
  H. Verify completeness gate
     Verification queue expects 3 verifier files, phase writes only 2.
     Assert retry and degrade/halt instead of falsely completing.
  I. Phase-containment detector
     Inventory writes later-phase artifacts. Assert retry and degrade/halt.
  K. Inventory sharding
     L1 breadth produces enough analysis files to trigger inventory sharding.
     Assert chunk phases complete and final inventory is produced without a
     parity halt.

Not a unit test of internal helpers. Black-box check that the runtime
policy (critical halt, manifest-exact quorum, empty-queue short-circuit)
holds end-to-end. Monkeypatches `run_phase`, `detect_rate_limit`, and
`recon_prepass.run_recon_prepass` so we exercise only the phase loop —
not shell, git, or subprocess state.

Run: `python test_driver_smoke.py`.
