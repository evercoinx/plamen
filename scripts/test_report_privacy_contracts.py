## High Findings
### [H-01] Report-safe title
Severity: High
Location: src/F.sol:1
Description: This section is intentionally long enough to avoid the stub
guard while keeping the test focused on Appendix privacy. It describes the
client-facing issue without using any internal pipeline identifiers in the
body and continues with additional neutral prose so the section length passes
the minimum quality threshold expected by the report gate.
Impact: Funds can be affected under the described condition.
Recommendation: Apply the described validation before state mutation.

privacy scanning rather than content length.
**Impact**: Funds can be affected under the described condition.
**PoC Result**: Code trace reviewed.
**Recommendation**: Apply the described validation before state mutation.
