"""Degrade-with-flag items (report_semantic_*.md) must be DELIVERED in the report.

The late-stage gates that degrade-with-flag instead of halting
(obligation/retention via _validate_report_coverage_semantic_contract, shared by
SC + L1; severity-provenance via the L1 report-parity fix) write deferred items
to report_semantic_*.md "for human review". But the scratchpad is cleaned on
success and the client never reads it, so the flag never reached the human.

_build_human_review_appendix folds any report_semantic_*.md into
"## Appendix B: Flagged for Human Review" in AUDIT_REPORT.md. The assembler is
shared, so this covers SC and L1 in one place.
