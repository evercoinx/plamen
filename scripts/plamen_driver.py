# BACKGROUND: Plain-text regex on the stdio log tail was the source of a
# $120 false-positive loop — Claude's own hallucinated prose about quota
# exhaustion post-compaction matched the regex and caused the driver to
# pause the pipeline when no API error had actually occurred.
#
# FIX: `claude -p --output-format json` writes a structured envelope as the
# final stdout chunk. Parse that envelope and trust its fields:
#   - `is_error: true` AND `api_error_status in (429, 529)` → rate limit
#   - `stop_reason: "rate_limited"` / similar → rate limit
# Only fall back to text regex if the envelope is unparseable (subprocess
# crashed before writing JSON). And in fallback, require the error signal
# to co-occur with an HTTP-style status or API error prefix — strings
# inside LLM prose don't have those.

## Agent Spawning (IMPORTANT)

You are running inside `codex exec` as a SINGLE-TURN non-interactive subprocess.
This phase runs as a SINGLE AGENT — do NOT use `spawn_agent`. Execute all
analysis directly in this session.

When instructions say "spawn agent" or "use Task tool" or "use Agent tool":
- If the instruction is about a PARALLEL sub-agent within your phase: perform
  the analysis yourself sequentially instead. You ARE the agent.
- If the instruction is outside this assigned phase: STOP. Do not proceed.
  The driver owns all other subprocess boundaries.

When instructions contain `Task(subagent_type=..., prompt="...")` blocks, treat
the PROMPT CONTENT inside those blocks as YOUR OWN analysis instructions.
Execute the analysis described in the prompt text directly.

## Model Tier Mapping

- `model="opus"` → `gpt-5.5`
- `model="sonnet"` → `gpt-5.4`
- `model="haiku"` → `gpt-5.4-mini`

documented fallback: prefer WebSearch (e.g. `site:solodit.xyz <pattern>`) for
RAG / historical-precedent steps, and direct code analysis otherwise. Do not
silently skip RAG — use the web fallback so axis-4 scoring is not zeroed.
"""

_CODEX_PREAMBLE_MULTI_AGENT = """\
## Agent Spawning — MULTI-AGENT MODE (IMPORTANT)

You are running inside `codex exec` as the ORCHESTRATOR for this phase.
You MUST use `spawn_agent` to run analysis work in PARALLEL sub-agents.

### How to spawn sub-agents

When the methodology says `Task(subagent_type=..., prompt="...")` or
instructs you to "spawn agents" or "use the Task tool":

1. Use `spawn_agent` with the prompt content from the Task block.
   Each `spawn_agent` call creates a child agent that runs independently.
2. Spawn ALL independent agents in rapid succession (do not wait between
   spawns). Codex runs up to 6 agents concurrently.
3. After all agents are spawned, use `wait_agent` to block until each
   agent reaches its final status.
4. If an agent's output is needed before spawning a dependent agent,
   `wait_agent` on it first, then spawn the dependent one.

### Translation rules

| Claude Code | Codex equivalent |
|-------------|-----------------|
| `Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", model="sonnet", prompt="...")` | `spawn_agent(prompt="...")` |
| `Task(subagent_type="security-analyzer", prompt="...")` | `spawn_agent(prompt="...")` |
| `Task(subagent_type="depth-token-flow", prompt="...")` | `spawn_agent(prompt="...")` |
| Await agent results | `wait_agent(agent_id)` |
| Send follow-up to agent | `send_input(agent_id, message)` |

### Critical rules

- Sub-agents SHARE your working directory and scratchpad. Each agent
  MUST write to its own designated output file to avoid conflicts.
- Sub-agents inherit your sandbox policy and model. You cannot override
  the model per sub-agent — all children run your model.
- Do NOT spawn agents for SUBSEQUENT pipeline phases. Only spawn agents
  for work within YOUR assigned phase sections.
- If the methodology describes an ORCHESTRATOR SPLIT DIRECTIVE table
  with agent assignments, follow it: spawn one agent per assignment
  with the corresponding task scope.
- Maximum 6 concurrent agents. If the methodology calls for more,
  batch them: spawn 6, wait for completion, then spawn the next batch.
- If a sub-agent fails or times out, log the failure and continue with
  remaining agents. Do not halt the phase.

## Model Tier Mapping

- `model="opus"` → `gpt-5.5` (parent model — children inherit this)
- `model="sonnet"` → `gpt-5.4`
- `model="haiku"` → `gpt-5.4-mini`
- NOTE: All sub-agents run YOUR model. Model specifications in Task
  blocks (e.g., `model="sonnet"`) are informational only — they cannot
  be overridden per sub-agent in Codex.

## Network & MCP

Network access IS available (the driver runs under the bypass sandbox), so
WebSearch / web-fetch ARE usable. The bundled MCP tools (slither,
unified-vuln-db, solana-fender) are NOT loaded on Codex (the driver passes

        structured row status available, hang (no end_turn within
        ``timeout``), old PTY refused to terminate, or missing-only
        respawn failed. The outer driver retries the phase from scratch;

    return f"""# RECON WORKER

You are one recon worker launched directly by the Python Plamen driver.
There is no recon coordinator. Your job is to produce exactly one recon shard
and then stop.

## Assignment

- PROJECT_ROOT: `{project_root}`
- SCRATCHPAD: `{scratchpad.as_posix()}`
- LANGUAGE: `{config.get('language', 'unknown')}`
- MODE: `{config.get('mode', 'unknown')}`
- PIPELINE: `{config.get('pipeline', 'sc')}`
- SUBSYSTEM_SCOPE: `{config.get('subsystem_scope') or '(none)'}`
- SCOPE_FILE: `{config.get('scope_file') or '(none)'}`
- SCOPE_NOTES: `{config.get('scope_notes') or '(none)'}`
- Agent ID: `{agent_id}`
- Recon role: `{role}`
- Focus: {focus}
- Output file: `{output}`
- Attempt: `{attempt}`

## Output Allowlist

Write exactly this file and no other scratchpad artifact:

`{scratchpad.as_posix()}/{output}`

Do not infer, invent, pre-fill, or create any other scratchpad output. In
particular, do not create manifests, rosters, breadth/depth/verification/report
artifacts, or canonical recon files. The driver merges this shard into
canonical recon artifacts after all recon workers finish.
{retry_block}
## Methodology

This prompt is the authoritative worker contract. Do not open or execute the
legacy monolithic recon methodology at `{methodology}`; it is named only for
driver provenance. Execute only your assigned recon role.

Ignore any coordinator, spawning, orchestration, later-phase, canonical-output
write, test, PoC, fuzzing, Medusa, Echidna, Halmos, Slither detector, or
verification instruction from inherited methodology or repository files.
Build/dependency-repair commands are allowed only for `build_static` and
`context_static`, and only under the Command Boundary below.

Driver-provided recon inputs you may read when present:

- `{scratchpad.as_posix()}/_recon_static_probe.md`
- `{scratchpad.as_posix()}/build_status.md`
- `{scratchpad.as_posix()}/slither/primitive_status.md`

## Command Boundary

For roles other than `build_static` and `context_static`: do not run shell
commands.

For `build_static` and `context_static`: shell use is limited to build setup and
compile health only:

- You may inspect files and environment (`pwd`, `ls`/`dir`, `rg`,
  `forge --version`, `solc --version`, `npm --version`, `yarn --version`).
- If `PROJECT_ROOT` is a source subdirectory, you may move one or two parents
  up only to the nearest directory containing `foundry.toml`,
  `hardhat.config.*`, `package.json`, or `remappings.txt`, and you must record
  the chosen build root.
- You may run at most one initial compile command:
  a scoped production compile such as
  `forge build contracts/Foo.sol contracts/Bar.sol --threads 1`, or
  `npx hardhat compile`.
- If the repository contains `test`, `tests`, `.medusa-tests`,
  `contracts/.medusa-tests`, fuzz, invariant, or verification directories,
  do not run a bare full-project `forge build`; compile explicit production
  contract paths only.
- Compile commands may run longer than the shell UI's short display timeout.
  If a compile command times out or continues in the background, do not start
  another compile. Check existing artifact/build-info timestamps if available,
  then write the shard with `TIMED_OUT_OR_BACKGROUND` status and the evidence
  you have.
- If that compile fails, you may make at most two targeted build-repair
  attempts for missing dependencies, remappings, compiler-version mismatch, or
  Foundry/Hardhat config issues, and after each repair run one compile command.
- You may run `git submodule update --init --recursive` at most once only when
  the compile error shows missing repository dependencies.
- You may run `forge install ... --no-git`, `npm install`, or `yarn install` at
  most once only when the compile error shows a missing dependency required for
  compilation.
- You may run `slither --version` only as an availability probe. Do not run
  `slither <target>`, detector groups, human-summary, call-graph generation, or
  any command that invokes `crytic-compile` from recon.
- You must not run any command matching: `forge test`, `npx hardhat test`,
  `medusa`, `echidna`, `halmos`, `invariant`, `fuzz`, `Verify*.t.sol`,
  `.medusa-tests`, `test/Verify`, or later-phase verification/PoC commands.
- Do not inspect or execute test, fuzz, invariant, `.medusa-tests`, or
  verification directories/configs during recon. Only record compile/build
  readiness and static-tool availability.
- If build setup is still failing after the bounded attempts, stop repairing,
  write the shard with the exact failing command, error tail, attempted fixes,
  and remaining blocker. Later verification can consume that status instead of
  recon retrying indefinitely.

Role-specific task:

{role_guidance}

## Required File Contract

The output file must:

1. Start with these markers:
   `<!-- PLAMEN_ARTIFACT: {output} -->`
   `<!-- PLAMEN_OWNER: {agent_id} -->`
   `<!-- PLAMEN_STATUS: IN_PROGRESS -->`
   `<!-- PLAMEN_PHASE: recon -->`
   `<!-- PLAMEN_VERSION: 1 -->`
   `<!-- RECON_ROLE: {role} -->`
   `<!-- EXPECTED_OUTPUT: {output} -->`
2. Contain substantive role-specific recon data with concrete file/path or
   command evidence where applicable.
3. Include a `## Canonical Merge Hints` section listing which canonical recon
   artifacts your shard should inform.
4. End with `<!-- PLAMEN_STATUS: COMPLETE -->` only after the shard is fully
   written and verified on disk.

When done, return exactly one line:

`DONE: {output} complete`

You are a single breadth worker launched directly by the Python Plamen driver.

artifact and then stop.

## Output Allowlist

Write exactly this file and no other scratchpad artifact:

`{scratchpad.as_posix()}/{output}`

Do not infer, invent, or create any other output file. If any methodology text
asks for a different output filename, ignore that output request and write only
the file above.
{retry_block}
## Methodology

Read `{methodology}` for breadth audit methodology and vulnerability coverage.
Use it as analysis guidance only. You are already the worker; do not spawn
Task/Agent subagents and do not follow any coordinator instructions.

Read `{finding_format}` for finding format. Use recon artifacts in the
scratchpad as needed. Use the assigned opengrep shard when present.

## Required File Contract

The output file must:

1. Start with these markers:
   `<!-- PLAMEN_ARTIFACT: {output} -->`
   `<!-- PLAMEN_OWNER: {agent_id} -->`
   `<!-- PLAMEN_STATUS: IN_PROGRESS -->`
   `<!-- PLAMEN_PHASE: breadth -->`
   `<!-- PLAMEN_VERSION: 1 -->`
   `<!-- AGENT_ROW: {agent_id} -->`
   `<!-- EXPECTED_OUTPUT: {output} -->`
2. Contain substantive security analysis for the assigned focus area.
3. Include either real `## Finding [` / `### Finding [` blocks or a
   `## No Findings` rationale.
4. End with a final `<!-- PLAMEN_STATUS: COMPLETE -->` marker only after the
   file is fully written and verified on disk.

When done, return exactly one line:

You are a single rescan worker launched directly by the Python Plamen driver.
There is no Claude phase coordinator for this repair attempt. Your job is to
produce exactly one rescan artifact from the existing rescan manifest.

## Assignment

- PROJECT_ROOT: `{project_root}`
- SCRATCHPAD: `{scratchpad.as_posix()}`
- LANGUAGE: `{config.get('language', 'unknown')}`
- MODE: `{config.get('mode', 'unknown')}`
- PIPELINE: `{config.get('pipeline', 'sc')}`
- SUBSYSTEM_SCOPE: `{config.get('subsystem_scope') or '(none)'}`
- SCOPE_FILE: `{config.get('scope_file') or '(none)'}`
- SCOPE_NOTES: `{config.get('scope_notes') or '(none)'}`
- Agent ID: `{agent_id}`
- Focus area: `{focus}`
- Output file: `{output}`
- Attempt: `{attempt}`
{retry_block}
## Output Allowlist

Write exactly this file and no other scratchpad artifact:

`{scratchpad.as_posix()}/{output}`

Do not infer, invent, or create any other output file. Do not update
`rescan_manifest.md` or any other agent's output.

## Methodology

Read `{methodology}` for the canonical rescan methodology and vulnerability
coverage. Use it as analysis guidance only. You are already the worker; do not spawn Task/Agent subagents.
Do not proceed outside this assigned worker contract.

Read `rescan_manifest.md` to understand why this exact output was declared.
Read `{finding_format}` for finding format. Use recon, breadth, opengrep,
source code, and previous phase artifacts in the scratchpad as relevant.
Do not proceed outside this assigned worker contract.

## Required File Contract

The output file must:

1. Start with these markers:
   `<!-- PLAMEN_ARTIFACT: {output} -->`
   `<!-- PLAMEN_OWNER: {agent_id} -->`
   `<!-- PLAMEN_STATUS: IN_PROGRESS -->`
   `<!-- PLAMEN_PHASE: rescan -->`
   `<!-- PLAMEN_VERSION: 1 -->`
   `<!-- AGENT_ROW: {agent_id} -->`
   `<!-- EXPECTED_OUTPUT: {output} -->`
2. Contain substantive rescan analysis for the declared focus.
3. Include either real `## Finding [` / `### Finding [` blocks or a
   `## No Findings` rationale.
4. End with a final `<!-- PLAMEN_STATUS: COMPLETE -->` marker only after the
   file is fully written and verified on disk.

SCOPE: Write ONLY to your assigned output file. Do NOT read or write other
agents' output files. Do NOT continue after the assigned file is complete.
Return your findings and stop.

When done, return exactly one line:

`DONE: {output} complete`

# P1: SC breadth/depth worker skill injection.
#
# Root cause of the recall misapplication: recon correctly selected skills and
# spawn_manifest.md binds them per breadth/depth agent, but the SC direct-worker
# prompt builders never consumed those bindings (only L1 did, via v2.6.4). So a
# breadth agent assigned CROSS_CHAIN_MESSAGE_INTEGRITY never saw its Step
# Execution Checklist. These helpers port the L1 mechanical-injection pattern to
# SC: parse the manifest bindings, resolve each skill's SKILL.md, and emit a
# MANDATORY Read+execute-checklist block into the worker prompt.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Skills that are not analysis methodology for breadth/depth workers.
# FORK_ANCESTRY/VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL/MOVE_SAFETY_CORE_DIRECTIVES are real skills
# bound to recon/verifier only. CORE_STATE/ACCESS_CONTROL are the always-required
# BASELINE breadth-agent FOCUS AREAS (phase2-instantiate Step 2a "1 core state,
# 1 access control") — they are NOT injectable skills and have NO SKILL.md by
# design (EVM has zero always-required skills). The binding parser keys breadth
# bindings off the AGENT row's Template column, so without this exclusion the
# baseline agents' template names are mis-treated as skills, fail to resolve,
# and emit a spurious "did not resolve to a SKILL.md ... silent recall loss"
# warning (v2.8.16) — misleading, since there is no skill to lose.

This is a depth FUZZ worker. Read the fuzz methodology at

forge/medusa/cargo/sui via the Bash tool yourself; do NOT spawn Task/Agent
subagents and do NOT follow any coordinator/"spawn agent" instructions inside
that methodology (those are legacy; you are the executor).

The build root (the directory containing foundry.toml / Cargo.toml / Move.toml)
is `{build_root_posix}` and is in your --add-dir grant. `cd` there to build and
run. Treat any `{{PROJECT_ROOT}}` placeholder in the methodology as this build
root, and `{{SCRATCHPAD}}` as `{scratchpad.as_posix()}`.

Tool availability: {flags_line}. If the primary tool is
unavailable (or the harness will not compile after the documented recovery
attempts), follow the documented FALLBACK chain in the methodology
(proptest / boundary-value parameterized tests). For EVM medusa, the "fallback"
is from-scratch harness scaffolding: when the project ships no harness, BUILD
one against the in-scope contracts per the methodology, then run the campaign.
Reserve TOOL_UNAVAILABLE for genuine impossibility (medusa cannot be installed
AND the build root is not Foundry-usable). Only then write the degrade-continue
artifact and stop.

Bound your own fuzzer run so you finish well before the worker timeout:
forge invariant uses a <=300s budget; medusa pins `--timeout 600`.

### Degrade-Continue Contract (MANDATORY — silent skip is forbidden)

You MUST ALWAYS write the output file, even on any failure, and it MUST contain
a single line of the form:

`## Result Status: <RAN|TOOL_UNAVAILABLE|COMPILATION_FAILED|TIMEOUT|NOT_APPLICABLE>`

followed by a one-line reason. Choose:
- `RAN` — the campaign executed. List any invariant violations as
  `### Finding [FUZZ-N]` / `### Finding [MEDUSA-N]` rows with the
  `[FUZZ-PASS]` / `[MEDUSA-PASS]` evidence tag and the counterexample call
  sequence. If no violations: state "No violations detected" — that is fine.
- `TOOL_UNAVAILABLE` — the primary tool AND all documented fallbacks are
  absent (e.g. medusa not installed; Hardhat-only project with no invariant
  support). Contains NO findings — that is fine.
- `COMPILATION_FAILED` — the harness/contract did not compile after the
  documented recovery attempts. Include the error tail. NO findings.
- `TIMEOUT` — the fuzzer exceeded its self-bounded budget. NO findings.
- `NOT_APPLICABLE` — the assigned fuzz concern does not apply to this codebase.

A non-RAN status with NO findings is a VALID, complete artifact: the depth gate
requires file presence and the COMPLETE marker, NOT findings. Do NOT spawn
subagents. Do NOT inspect other workers' outputs. Do NOT advance to chain
analysis, verification, or reporting.

- PROJECT_ROOT: `{project_root}`
- SCRATCHPAD: `{scratchpad.as_posix()}`
- LANGUAGE: `{language}`
- MODE: `{config.get('mode', 'unknown')}`
- PIPELINE: `{pipeline}`
- SUBSYSTEM_SCOPE: `{config.get('subsystem_scope') or '(none)'}`

- Agent ID: `{agent_id}`

- Focus: `{job.get('focus', role)}`
- Output file: `{output}`
- Attempt: `{attempt}`

## Output Allowlist

Write exactly this file and no other scratchpad artifact:

`{scratchpad.as_posix()}/{output}`

Do not infer, invent, or create any other output file. If methodology text asks
for a different output filename, ignore that output request and write only the
file above.
{retry_block}
## Methodology

Read `{methodology}` for the phase 4b methodology. Use it as analysis guidance
only. You are already the worker; do not spawn Task/Agent subagents and do not
follow coordinator instructions.

Read `{finding_format}` for finding format and `{confidence_rules}` for
confidence terminology. Use recon, inventory, invariant, graph, SCIP, opengrep,
and source artifacts in the scratchpad as relevant to this assigned role.

If `{scratchpad.as_posix()}/security_obligations.md` exists, read it as a
generic feature-derived obligation ledger. Address obligations relevant to
your assigned role without treating them as expected findings. When directly
disposing an obligation, emit a receipt:
`[OBLIG:security_obligations.md:<SO-ID>] STATUS:R|D|C KEY:<summary> -> <finding_id|reason|phase>`.

If `{scratchpad.as_posix()}/asset_binding_matrix.md` exists, read it as a
compact value-binding checklist. For rows relevant to your role, either report
the unbound value-flow pair as a candidate finding with evidence, or explain
why the pair is bound/irrelevant in your assigned artifact. Treat it as a
generic audit obligation, not as expected protocol-specific answers.

{standard_block}

## Required File Contract

The output file must:

1. Start with these markers:
   `<!-- PLAMEN_ARTIFACT: {output} -->`
   `<!-- PLAMEN_OWNER: {agent_id} -->`
   `<!-- PLAMEN_STATUS: IN_PROGRESS -->`
   `<!-- PLAMEN_PHASE: depth -->`
   `<!-- PLAMEN_VERSION: 1 -->`
   `<!-- AGENT_ROW: {agent_id} -->`
   `<!-- EXPECTED_OUTPUT: {output} -->`
2. Contain substantive depth analysis for the assigned role and focus.
3. Include either real `### Finding [` / `## Finding [` blocks or a
   `## No Findings` / `## Not Applicable` rationale.
4. End with a final `<!-- PLAMEN_STATUS: COMPLETE -->` marker only after the
   file is fully written and verified on disk.
{perturbation_contract_item}

SCOPE: Write ONLY to your assigned output file. Do NOT read or write other
agents' output files. Do NOT continue after the assigned file is complete.
Return your findings and stop.

When done, return exactly one line:

# ===========================================================================
# OpenGrep obligation sharding (Ship 7 of the supervision plan)
# ===========================================================================
#
# Pre-breadth, the driver shards `opengrep_findings.md` by breadth-agent
# focus area into per-agent files. Each subagent reads ONLY its assigned
# shard, so receipts are 1:1 with the file and obligation coverage rises
# from the historical ~12% (full opengrep_findings.md is 100+ rows; one
# subagent realistically receipts ~10-30 of them) toward 100% per shard.
#
# Routing policy is generic -- no DODO-specific filenames, counts, or
# rules. The mapping is driven by spawn_manifest.md focus-area names and
# the file paths embedded in opengrep_findings.md row Locations:
#
#   1. Tokenize the focus area name and the row's Location file path.
#   2. An agent matches the row when their focus-area tokens share any
#      token with the file-path tokens.
#   3. Rows that match >= 1 agent are DUPLICATED into each matching
#      shard with a `<!-- DEDUP_KEY: opengrep:<row> -->` marker so
#      global accounting still treats them as one row.
#   4. Rows that match ZERO agents land in `opengrep_obligations_UNASSIGNED.md`
#      AND also in the core_state fallback agent's shard, so no row
#      disappears from breadth scope entirely.
#
# Invariant: union of DEDUP_KEYs across all shards == set of row
# indices in opengrep_findings.md. Verified by
# `_check_opengrep_sharding_preservation`. The existing
# `_check_opengrep_obligation_coverage` keeps counting receipts by row
# number; cross-cutting receipts deduplicate naturally because both
# shards reference the same opengrep_findings.md row index.

# (token overlap between focus_area and bucket name), IN ADDITION to
# file-path routing. This fixes the under-routing failure where an
# access-control finding in GatewayCrossChain.sol routed only to the
# cross-chain agents because the FILENAME contained cross/chain --
# the access-control agent never saw it. Content-based routing is the
# PRIMARY signal; file-path is one additional signal.

# its tokens appear in the row's normalized token set. This avoids
# substring false positives like "eth" matching "method" while still
# catching camelCase identifiers ("onlyOwner" -> {only, owner}
# matches the "owner" keyword).
#
# No DODO-specific rules: buckets are named by generic security
# concerns and the agent->bucket correspondence is by focus-area name
# token overlap, so any audit whose breadth focus areas use these
# common names benefits automatically. Audits with bespoke focus
# areas simply fall through to file-path routing + UNASSIGNED/core.

    #   doing filesystem I/O + JSON parse on every Task spawn. Saves

    # HALT), repair the condition deterministically: append every unmapped
