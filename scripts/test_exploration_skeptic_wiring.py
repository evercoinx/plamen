"""Wiring + soft-validation tests for Phase 4b.6 (exploration completeness).

The exploration_skeptic phase is an independent, recall-positive /
ADDITIVE exploration-completeness verifier. It runs Thorough-only, after
the depth loop and its post-depth sub-phases (attention_repair, rag_sweep)
and before dedup/chain, so any added/upgraded/re-opened finding propagates
through the rest of the pipeline.

These tests lock in:

  1. The prompt mapping in `_STANDALONE_PROMPT_MAP` resolving via
     `_resolve_standalone_prompt`, with the prompt file present on disk.
  2. The Phase entry in `SC_PHASES`, Thorough-only + soft (critical=False).
  3. Placement: AFTER rag_sweep, BEFORE sc_semantic_dedup.
  4. Mode gating: absent in light/core scheduling, present in thorough.
  5. The soft validator never returns hard issues in any branch.

No protocol-specific content appears in these assertions.

# whose SPECIFIC instance mechanism was never resolved to a finding. The root
