"""End-to-end ZERO-DATA-LOSS chain test for the dedup -> report pipeline.

Models an INV-013/014 family from a prior L1 audit:

  * INV-013: consensus config-hash mismatch, INBOUND only,
    Source IDs {CI-1, NS-2}, peer_network_service.rs:990-1000, [CODE-TRACE],
    Medium.
  * INV-014: SAME config-hash mismatch PLUS a distinct OUTBOUND path,
    Source IDs {CI-1, NS-2, NS-7}, peer_network_service.rs:990-1048,
    [POC-PASS], High. INV-014 is the source-ID + location SUPERSET, so it MUST
    be the survivor.

A deterministic dedup_decisions.md (simulating the LLM/mechanical merge after
the survivor-superset gate) merges INV-013 INTO INV-014 with the outbound
content coupled. The test then drives the real driver chain:

  1. dedup post-swap propagation (_propagate_dedup_absorbed_to_finding_mapping)
  2. mechanical report_index + report_coverage build
  3. mechanical AUDIT_REPORT assembly

and asserts NO distinct attack path / severity / evidence is lost, INV-013 is
accounted as MERGED (not AUTO_EXCLUDED / not silently dropped), and the
pipeline does not halt.

Negative case: a large-aggregate KEEP-SEPARATE pair (15-source-ID INV-127 vs
INV-118) yields TWO distinct findings — neither absorbed.

### Finding [INV-014]: Consensus config-hash mismatch logged but not enforced
**Severity**: High
**Location**: peer_network_service.rs:990-1048
**Source IDs**: CI-1, NS-2, NS-7
**Preferred Tag**: POC-PASS
**Description**: The inbound handshake config-hash check at
peer_network_service.rs:990-1000 logs a mismatch but does not reject the peer.
Additionally, the outbound path at peer_network_service.rs:1041-1048 (absorbed
from INV-013) re-dials mismatched peers; this route must be fixed together with
the inbound check.
**Impact**: A peer with a mismatched consensus config is admitted (inbound) and
re-dialed (outbound), enabling cross-config gossip pollution.

### Finding [INV-127]: Outbound response-size OOM on client dial loop
**Severity**: High
**Location**: gossip_client.rs:150-170
**Source IDs**: NS-1, NS-2, NS-3, NS-4, NS-5, NS-6, NS-7, NS-8, NS-9, CI-1, CI-2, DS-1, DS-2, DS-3, DS-4
**Preferred Tag**: CODE-TRACE
**Description**: Unbounded outbound response buffering.
**Impact**: OOM under crafted oversized responses.

### Finding [INV-118]: Unbounded peers Vec on discovery ingest
**Severity**: Medium
**Location**: server.rs:1071-1108
**Source IDs**: NS-3
**Preferred Tag**: CODE-TRACE
**Description**: Discovery ingest appends to peers Vec without a cap.
**Impact**: Memory exhaustion via flooded discovery.
