"""TASK D — CHAIN-RESTATEMENT triage false-positive (root fix).

`_validate_report_index_triage_safety` previously WARNED that Medium+ excluded
chains lacked an allowed non-body reason even when those chains were
CHAIN-RESTATEMENT (NO-upgrade, absorbed into their body constituents) — a
legitimate consolidation per report-template rules.

Root fix: accept CHAIN-RESTATEMENT / CHAIN-DOWNGRADE (absorbed-into-body,
Severity-Upgrade-Justified: NO) as an allowed non-body reason, equivalent to
CONSOLIDATED.

Negative control (recall-safety): a chain with Severity-Upgrade-Justified: YES
(a real combined-impact compound finding) excluded WITHOUT a body home is a
genuinely dropped compound finding and MUST STILL be flagged.

GENERIC ONLY: neutral IDs (CH-0N / M-0N shapes), no protocol/finding names.

Run: pytest scripts/test_triage_chain_restatement.py -v
