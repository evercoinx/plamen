"""FIX #4 (L1 LLM-first report_index + mechanical backstop) and the Codex-only
extended retry budget for RECOVERING content phases.

Both fixes live in plamen_driver.py and are recall-safety constrained:

  FIX #4 — L1 report_index previously ALWAYS used the deterministic mechanical
  builder, so the LLM Index Agent's STEP 1.5 root-cause consolidation (which
  consumes [LIKELY-DUP] hints + dedup_candidate_pairs.md) never ran. The fix
  lets the LLM consolidation run FIRST, with `_write_mechanical_report_index`
  retained as the DETERMINISTIC BACKSTOP when the LLM index is
  missing/invalid/incomplete — so NO finding can vanish. SC behavior is
  unchanged.

  CODEX RETRY BUDGET — Codex single-pass workers under-cover content phases on
  the first run and recover when re-prompted. The fix grants the RECOVERING
  content phases (recon, breadth, inventory, inventory_chunk_*) up to 3 attempts
  ONLY when cli_backend == "codex". Claude (and every other backend), and every
  non-recovering phase (verify/report/skeptic/depth/chain/...), keep the
  unchanged retry-once-then-degrade budget of 2.

These tests reproduce the original failure modes (LLM consolidation never ran;
2nd Codex flake degraded) and prove they are fixed without weakening any gate.
