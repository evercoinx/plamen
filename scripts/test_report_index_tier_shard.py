"""TASK C — report_index tier-shard COMPLETION + seed-reconciliation.

LIVE FLAW (DODO): even with the bounded-ledger scope ban, report_index thrashed
~27 min because the LLM did whole-set STEP 1.5 consolidation + STEP 5/5.5
coverage over 30 hypotheses + a 121-finding mapping in ONE turn. The fix shards
the working set by report tier so no single turn holds the whole set, and wires
the driver-written coverage seed (the authoritative SUPERSET) into the
completeness gate so a sharded index can never let a finding fall between shards.

This module ships BOTH required fixtures:

  (1) FLAW-NOW-RESOLVED — the driver partitions the coverage seed into bounded
      per-tier shards whose UNION equals the full seed (zero drops, zero
      overlap), and a correctly-sharded index that disposes every seed ID PASSES
      the seed-reconciliation completeness gate.

  (2) NEGATIVE CONTROL — an index where a finding falls BETWEEN shards (a real
      seed ID left with no disposition) is STILL CAUGHT by the gate. The fix
      must not become a rubber-stamp: a genuine dropout still hard-fails.
