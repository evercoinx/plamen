"""v2.8.17 — L1 report_index haltless-parity.

Covers the L1 report_index stage fix (plamen_driver.py ~13327-13404) and the
rescan PLAMEN_STATUS write-flush wasted-retry fix (plamen_validators.py ~1620).

The driver branch under test is `pipeline == "l1" and phase.name ==
"report_index"`. Rather than booting the full phase loop, these tests exercise
the exact validator/repair functions that branch calls and assert the
HARD-vs-SOFT partition the fix relies on:

  - HALT-1 (prewrite, mechanical verify-file parity): _validate_verify_files_for_queue
  - HALT-2 (post-write, prose severity provenance): _validate_report_index_inputs
        + _repair_report_index_severity_provenance (repair-then-revalidate)
  - HALT-3 (coverage UNACCOUNTED, mechanical): _validate_report_coverage_accounting

The fix's contract:
  1. A PROSE-only issue (severity provenance that repair cannot safely auto-fix,
     e.g. an inflation) must NOT be a hard verify-file-parity issue — so the
     driver can flag it to report_semantic_severity_repairs.md and CONTINUE.
  2. A MECHANICAL issue (missing verify file for a queued ID, or an UNACCOUNTED
     coverage row) MUST still surface as a hard issue — silent-drop protection
     is preserved.
  3. A downgrade-only provenance violation is auto-repaired so attempt 1 clears
     (no wasted retry, no flag).

Fixtures are realistic: real verification_queue.md tables, real verify_<ID>.md
files with explicit Severity/Verdict fields, real report_index.md Master Finding
Index rows, and a real report_coverage.md ledger.
