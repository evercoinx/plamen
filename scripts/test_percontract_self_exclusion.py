"""BUG 2 / M-04 — Phase 3c per-contract belief-based self-exclusion.

A per-contract agent is GIVEN an orchestrator-built exclusion list (finding IDs
+ locations from analysis_*.md + analysis_rescan_*.md) and told "do not
re-report exclusion-list findings". Nothing constrains the PROVENANCE of an
exclusion, so an agent self-generated an "## Exclusion List (Already Found)"
section asserting a real bug was already known when NO provided finding
contained it — silently dropping a true positive.

Fix:
- PROMPT: an exclusion is valid only if it cites a concrete entry present in the
  provided exclusion list; a believed-known bug with no provided-list referent
  MUST be emitted (rules/phase3b-rescan-prompt.md + prompts/shared/v2/...).
- GATE: _validate_percontract_self_exclusion flags referent-less exclusions and
  the driver re-emits them to analysis_percontract_reemit.md (declared into
  rescan_manifest.md so the exact gate still accepts it).

Recall-safe: the validator ONLY ever adds candidates; never removes/refutes a
finding, never hard-fails a clean run.
