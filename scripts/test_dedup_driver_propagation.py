"""Driver-side dedup tests: absorbed->survivor propagation + multi-round
carry-forward exclusion list.

These cover the plamen_driver.py changes for the dedup-throughput upgrade:

  * ``_dedup_absorbed_survivor_mapping`` — parse both the LLM ``MERGED into``
    rows and the mechanical ``MECHANICAL_MERGE/SUPPLEMENT`` rows into a
    {absorbed: {survivor, coupled}} map.
  * ``_write_dedup_absorbed_map`` — driver-owned sidecar read by Chain Agent 1.
  * ``_propagate_dedup_absorbed_to_finding_mapping`` — records absorbed IDs as
    constituents of their survivor's hypothesis (sidecar always; in-place edit
    of finding_mapping.md when it exists).
  * ``_build_dedup_round_exclusion_block`` / ``_stage_dedup_round_packet`` —
    multi-round carry-forward so each pair is decided exactly once.

ZERO-DATA-LOSS posture: propagation is purely additive; carry-forward prevents
re-deciding (oscillation) but never blind-merges. No merge is applied here.
