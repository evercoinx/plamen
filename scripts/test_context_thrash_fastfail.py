"""Context-overflow / autocompact-thrash fast-fail (Ship 8.17).

The PTY wait loop already flips ``output_truncated`` for the model OUTPUT cap.
But the INPUT side -- a turn whose context has grown so large that Claude Code
is stuck auto-compacting (or has explicitly given up) -- had no dedicated exit:
the transcript keeps emitting compaction-summary / re-read events so the
quiescence gate never trips, the process stays alive, and it is NOT the output
cap. The ONLY terminator was the full scaled phase deadline (observed: ~3.6h
burn on a 144K-finding report index).

These tests pin:
  1. the overflow/thrash regex matches the real fingerprints (and not benign text);
  2. the dual-signal gate fires only when thrash text/compaction is present AND
     no new PRODUCTIVE event has advanced for >= _CONTEXT_THRASH_LOOP_S;
  3. a compact-THEN-RESUME turn (productive_event_count rises) is NEVER cut off;
  4. a non-thrash session is byte-unaffected;
  5. the real wait_for_turn_complete returns EARLY (well before the deadline)
     on a sustained thrash signature.
