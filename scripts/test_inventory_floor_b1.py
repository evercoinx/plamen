"""B1 inventory floor + B2 verify graceful fallback negative controls.

The inventory phase can degrade (a chunk failed, the LLM merge truncated, the
file was never written or is empty). When that happens `findings_inventory.md`
is missing and verification terminally halts even though real findings exist on
disk in the breadth/depth/chunk artifacts.

`ensure_findings_inventory_floor` reconstructs the inventory honestly from the
completed artifacts. The invariant is recall-safety: NEVER fewer findings than
exist in the source artifacts (no loss), NEVER more (no fabrication). A truly
empty scratchpad yields a valid empty inventory, not a crash. An inventory that
already holds real findings is left untouched (NO-OP — never clobbered, never
re-fabricated).
