"""Realistic resume-revert regression for the verify-queue completeness fix.

This is the test the prior (committed) backfill LACKED. The prior fix raw-
appended 6-column rows AFTER the manifest footer line and left the JSON sidecar
stale, so `parse_verification_queue_rows` (sidecar-authoritative) never saw the
backfilled rows, `_compute_unrouted_inventory_ids` stayed non-empty, the
verify_queue parity gate kept failing, and the resume reconciliation rewound
~15 downstream verify phases on EVERY attempt -> infinite rewind loop.

This test reproduces the FULL reality:
  * findings_inventory.md in the exact `_inventory_blocks` format
  * a queue persisted via the CANONICAL writer (`_write_queue_subset_manifest`),
    so verification_queue.json exists and is authoritative
  * the parity gap seen THROUGH the JSON sidecar (not a toy markdown fixture)
  * a real L1 Checkpoint with verify_queue + the downstream verify phases
    marked completed
  * the real `_reconcile_completed_checkpoint_artifacts` resume path

The load-bearing assertion (Part E): after the canonical backfill closes the
gap, reconciliation returns [] and NONE of the verify phases are rewound.
