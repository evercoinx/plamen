"""Ship 8.15 -- Targeted recon repair.

Root cause (prior post-mortem): on a recon gate failure, `_quarantine_stale_on_retry`
quarantined EVERY expected artifact >=500 bytes regardless of which one failed.
A 443-byte recon_summary.md failure quarantined 5 VALID drafts (design_context,
contract_inventory, state_variables, function_list, template_recommendations),
forcing a full re-run + recompaction.

Fix: quarantine ONLY the artifacts implicated by the gate-failure messages
(the `missing` list, previously passed-but-ignored). Fallback to broad
quarantine when no expected artifact is named (global/structural failure).
