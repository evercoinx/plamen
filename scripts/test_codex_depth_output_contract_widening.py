"""2026-06-02: Codex depth Expected-Output-Contract widening.

Root cause: the base depth prompt's `OUTPUT ALLOWLIST (HARD)` and `PHASE
ISOLATION CONTRACT` derive their allowed/writable set from "this phase's
Expected Output Contract", which lists only the `depth_*_findings.md` core glob
(from `phase.expected_artifacts`). On Codex (single-turn, full base prompt) the
model reads the allowlist literally and refuses the never-cut secondaries
(blind-spot scanners, validation sweep, confidence, niche) as "outside the
allowlist" — failing the never-cut gate even though it precreated them and the
checklist asked for them. Claude PTY never hits this: its depth prompt is
replaced by the worker-pool stub (one allowlisted worker per artifact).

Fix: `_codex_widen_depth_output_contract` lists the secondaries INSIDE the
Expected Output Contract so both downstream HARD references include them. It
runs ONLY inside `_translate_prompt_for_codex` (the `backend == "codex"` path),
so it cannot affect a Claude run.
